 <br>
<p>In a warm and sultry evergreen forest many miles away from the nearest town, there once lived a mother fruit bat and her recently born baby. Oh, Mother Bat loved her soft tiny baby so very much.<br>
 <br>
Looking at her baby, Mother said, &quot;I'll name you Stellaluna.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Each night after the sun set, Mother Bat would delicately carry Stellaluna clutched to her smooth breast as she flew out into the cool evening air to search for dinner for them.<br>
 <br>
One night in the summer, as Mother Bat followed the rich scent of ripe berries, a sneaky owl spied her. On wings quiet as a mouse the powerful bird swooped down upon the unsuspecting bats. Dodging and shrieking with fear, Mother Bat tried desperately to escape the owl&rsquo;s menacing claws, but the owl struck again and again, sending Stellaluna flying into the crisp, night air. Her fragile wings were as limp and useless as soggy paper, crumbling under their own weight. Down, down she went, faster and faster, into the sea of evergreens below.<br>
 <br>
The dark green leafy tangle of branches caught Stellaluna gently as she tumbled down. One twig was just the right size for Stellaluna's tiny webbed feet. Wrapping her wings tightly about her, she clutched the thin, crooked branch, trembling uncontrollably with cold chills and terror. <br>
 <br>
Stellaluna squealed into the night, &quot;Mother Bat Where are you?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Hours later, by early daybreak, the baby bat could hold on no longer. Down, down again she dropped.<br>
 <br>
Flump! Stellaluna landed headfirst in the heart of a cushioned downy nest, startling the three baby bluebirds who lived there. Stellaluna quickly clambered from the nest and hung out of sight below it. She listened attentively to the constant babble of the three baby bluebirds.<br>
 <br>
Flap asked, &quot;What was that?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Flitter said, &quot;I don't know, but it's hanging by its little feet.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Pip said, &quot;Shhh! Here comes Mama.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Many, many times that day Mama Bird flew away, always returning with enough food for her babies. Stellaluna was terribly hungry - but not for the bugs that Mama Bird found that were still crawling when she brought them. Finally, though, the scrawny bat could bear her hunger any longer. She climbed into the downy nest, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth wide. Plop! In dropped an enormous crunchy green grasshopper!<br>
 <br>
Within a few weeks, Stellaluna learned to act like the other bluebirds. She stayed awake all day and slept at night. She ate the squirmy bugs even though they tasted like rotten berries. Her bat mannerisms were quickly disappearing. Except for one thing: Stellaluna still preferred to sleep hanging upside-down by her feet.<br>
