<p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In a sun-warmed</span><span class="c0">68F</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and sultry evergreen forest away</span><span class="c0">30 miles</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from Hapstown, Pennsylvania, there once lived a protective</span><span class="c0">7/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;mother pygmy fruit-eating bat named Solarem, and her newborn baby. Solarem loved her soft small</span><span class="c0">4 inches</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;baby like a moth loves a light.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Staring into her baby&rsquo;s eyes, Solarem whispered</span><span class="c0">10dB</span><span class="c1">, &quot;I&#39;ll name you Stellaluna.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Each night</span><span class="c0">6pm</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;after the sun set behind the mountain, Solarem would delicately carry Stellaluna clutched to her smooth, warm</span><span class="c0">101F</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;breast as she caught the cool</span><span class="c0">59F</span><span class="c1">, evening breeze on her way to search for a dinner of Stellaluna&rsquo;s favorite fresh</span><span class="c0">9/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;fruits.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">One humid</span><span class="c0">80%</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;summer night</span><span class="c0">7 months</span><span class="c1">, as Solarem followed the rich</span><span class="c0">8/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;scent of ripe</span><span class="c0">7/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;berries wafting by, a sneaky</span><span class="c0">10/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;brown barn owl named Stark spied her from her perch, located above</span><span class="c0">2 feet</span><span class="c1">. On wings quiet</span><span class="c0">15dB</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as a mouse the powerful</span><span class="c0">8/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;barn owl swooped down upon the unsuspecting</span><span class="c0">7/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;mother and daughter fruit bats. Dodging and shrieking hysterically, her wings batting</span><span class="c0">3Hz</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;fiercely, Solarem tried desperately to escape Stark&rsquo;s menacing</span><span class="c0">10/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;sharp</span><span class="c0">10/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;talons, but the owl struck</span><span class="c0">6 times</span><span class="c1">, and on the strike</span><span class="c0">7th time</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;sent Stellaluna flying up</span><span class="c0">2 feet</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;into the crisp</span><span class="c0">7/10</span><span class="c1">, night air. Her fragile</span><span class="c0">8/10</span><span class="c1">, baby wings were as limp</span><span class="c0">9/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and useless</span><span class="c0">8/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as soggy paper, crumbling under their own weight</span><span class="c0">10 grams</span><span class="c1">. She fell, accelerating because of gravity at rate</span><span class="c0">9.8 m/s/s</span><span class="c1">, into the unforgiving</span><span class="c0">7/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;gathering of evergreen trees far below</span><span class="c0">20 feet</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A particularly thick</span><span class="c0">7/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;leafy tangle of intertwined branches captured Stellaluna in its wooden arms with a gentle</span><span class="c0">6/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;thump&rdquo; as she fell uncontrollably through the trees. &nbsp;One particularly prominent</span><span class="c0">8/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;twig was just the right diameter</span><span class="c0">5mm</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for Stellaluna&#39;s tiny</span><span class="c0">9/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;webbed feet</span><span class="c0">8mm</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to clutch. Wrapping her delicate</span><span class="c0">8/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;brown wings tightly about her, she clutched the crooked</span><span class="c0">5/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;branch, which was about as thin in diameter</span><span class="c0">7mm</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and wrinkled as a worm, and trembled uncontrollably with cold</span><span class="c0">55F</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;chills and paralyzing terror. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Stellaluna squealed as loud</span><span class="c0">103 dB</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as she could into the empty</span><span class="c0">5/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;night, &quot;Mother Bat, Where are you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Later</span><span class="c0">3 hours</span><span class="c1">, as the sky was starting to brighten</span><span class="c0">40,000 lux</span><span class="c1">, the baby bat&#39;s body was tired</span><span class="c0">10/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and could hold on no longer. She was forced to let go of the branch. Down far</span><span class="c0">30 feet</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;through the branches, she dropped.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A noise</span><span class="c0">60 dB</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that sounded like a tree falling onto the ground echoed out as Stellaluna landed</span><span class="c0">10 m/s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;headfirst in the heart of a cushioned downy</span><span class="c0">7/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;nest, startling the baby Eastern bluebirds</span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;who lived there. In time</span><span class="c0">4 seconds</span><span class="c1">, Stellaluna clambered</span><span class="c0">0.2 m/s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;out of the nest onto the branches below and hung below</span><span class="c0">2 inches</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;it where she could not be seen by them. She listened attentively to the conversation that the bluebirds</span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;were having with each other.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hearing the commotion, the bluebird</span><span class="c0">1</span><span class="c1">, named Flap, asked the others curiously, &quot;What was that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The bluebird</span><span class="c0">2</span><span class="c1">, named Flitter, responded amusedly, &quot;I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s hanging by its little</span><span class="c0">8/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;feet.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The bluebird</span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c1">, named Pip, warned urgently, &quot;Shhh! Here comes Mama.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The mother bird, named Glide, came to the nest, and then left soon after</span><span class="c0">2 minutes</span><span class="c1">. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That day Glide flew</span><span class="c0">4 times</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to go get food, returning with a beakful of insects</span><span class="c0">2-4 insects</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for her babies to consume for nutrition</span><span class="c0">450 calories</span><span class="c1">. Stellaluna&rsquo;s empty</span><span class="c0">10/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;stomach grumbled with hunger- but not for the bugs that Glide gathered that were still crawling when she brought them. Finally</span><span class="c0">4 hours</span><span class="c1">, though, the scrawny</span><span class="c0">9/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;bat could bear her hunger</span><span class="c0">10/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;any longer. Deciding to eat, Stellaluna climbed into the downy</span><span class="c0">7/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;nest next to the bluebirds, closed her frightened</span><span class="c0">9/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;eyes, and opened her beak as wide</span><span class="c0">12mm</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as she could. Plop! In dropped an crunchy</span><span class="c0">6/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;green grasshopper, named Flick, the size of her head</span><span class="c0">5cm^2</span><span class="c1">! Stellaluna swallowed Flick with a grimace.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That was the first time Stellaluna acted like an Eastern bluebird. Within time</span><span class="c0">2 weeks</span><span class="c1">, Stellaluna learned to act more and more like Flap, Flitter, and Pip. She stayed awake</span><span class="c0">8-18 hours</span><span class="c1">, and slept</span><span class="c0">18-8hrs</span><span class="c1">. She ate the squirmy</span><span class="c0">9/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;worms</span><span class="c0">2 per day</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and grasshoppers</span><span class="c0">1 per day</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;even though they tasted like rotten</span><span class="c0">2 weeks old</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;blueberries. Her fruit bat mannerisms were quickly being replaced by bluebird mannerisms. Except for one thing: Stellaluna still preferred to sleep hanging upside-down by the curled</span><span class="c0">7/10</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;toes of her feet.</span></p>
