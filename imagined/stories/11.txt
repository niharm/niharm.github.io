 <br>
<p>In a warm and sultry evergreen forest many miles away, there once lived a mother fruit bat and her new baby. Oh, how Mother Bat loved her soft tiny baby.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I'll name you Stellaluna.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Each night, Mother Bat would carry Stellaluna clutched to her smooth breast as she flew out to search for dinner.<br>
 <br>
One night, as Mother Bat followed the rich scent of ripe fruit, an owl spied her. On dead silent wings the powerful bird swooped down upon the unsuspecting bats. Dodging and shrieking, Mother Bat tried desperately to escape, but the owl struck again and again, knocking Stellaluna into the cool, night air. Her baby wings were as limp and useless as soggy paper. Down, down she went, faster and faster, into the forest below.<br>
 <br>
The dark green leafy tangle of branches caught Stellaluna as she tumbled down. One twig was small enough for Stellaluna's tiny webbed feet. Wrapping her wings tightly about her, she clutched the thin branch, trembling uncontrollably with cold and fear.<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna squealed, &quot;Mother Bat Where are you?&quot;<br>
 <br>
By early daybreak, the baby bat could hold on no longer. Down, down again she dropped.<br>
 <br>
Flump! Stellaluna landed headfirst in a cushioned downy nest, startling the three baby birds who lived there. Stellaluna quickly clambered from the nest and hung out of sight below it. She listened to the constant babble of the three baby birds.<br>
 <br>
Flap: &quot;What was that?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Flitter: &quot;I don't know, but it's hanging by its little feet.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Pip: &quot;Shhh! Here comes Mama.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Many, many times that day Mama Bird flew away, always returning with enough food for her babies. Stellaluna was terribly hungry - but not for the creepy crawly things Mama Bird brought. Finally, though, the scrawny bat could bear it no longer. She climbed into the downy nest, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth wide. Plop! In dropped a large green grasshopper!<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna learned to be like the other birds. She stayed awake all day and slept at night. She ate the squirmy bugs even though they tasted awful. Her bat ways were quickly disappearing. Except for one thing: Stellaluna still liked to sleep hanging by her feet.</p>
