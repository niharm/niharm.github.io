<br>
<p>Somewhere was an animal and her baby. Oh, how Mother felt about her baby.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I'll call you Stellaluna.&quot;<br>
 <br>
At night, Mother took Stellaluna to look for things.<br>
 <br>
Once, as Mother went after food, an animal saw her. The animal went down. Mother tried to go, but the animal came back, causing Stellaluna to go. Her wings were bad. Down she went.<br>
 <br>
The branches got Stellaluna. One branch was a good size. Putting her wings around, she held the branch.<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna said, &quot;Mother, where are you?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Then, the animal could not hold on. She dropped.<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna ended up in a nest, scaring the animals. Stellaluna left and went below it. She heard the animals.<br>
 <br>
Flap: &quot;What was that?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Flitter: &quot;I don't know, but it's hanging.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Pip: &quot;Here comes Mama.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Sometimes Mama went away and came back with things. Stellaluna was hungry - but not for what Mama had. Finally, the animal could not bear it. She went into the nest, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth. In went a bug!<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna started to be like the animals. She was awake in the day and asleep at night. She ate bugs but didn&rsquo;t like them. Her ways were changing. Except for one: Stellaluna still hung the same way.<br>
