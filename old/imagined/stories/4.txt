<br>
<p>In a place, there was an animal and her baby. Oh, how Mother loved her baby.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I'll name you Stellaluna.&quot;<br>
 <br>
At night, Mother took Stellaluna as she went to look for food.<br>
 <br>
Once, as Mother went after the smell of food, an owl saw her. The bird went down to the animals. Mother tried to go, but the owl came back, causing Stellaluna to go into the air. Her wings were bad. Down she went.<br>
 <br>
The branches caught Stellaluna. One branch was the right size. Putting her wings around her, she held the branch.<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna said, &quot;Mother, where are you?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Then, the bat could not hold on more. She dropped.<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna ended up in a nest, scaring the animals. Stellaluna left and went below it. She heard the animals.<br>
 <br>
Flap: &quot;What was that?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Flitter: &quot;I don't know, but it's hanging upside-down.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Pip: &quot;Here comes Mama.&quot;<br>
 <br>
That day Mama went away, coming back with food for her babies. Stellaluna was hungry - but not for what Mama had. Finally, the animal could not bear it. She went into the nest, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth. In went a bug!<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna started to become like the animals. She was awake in the day and asleep at night. She ate bugs but she didn&rsquo;t like them. Her ways were going away. Except for one: Stellaluna still hung upside-down.</p>
