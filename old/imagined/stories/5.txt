<br>
<p>In a forest, there lived a bat and her baby. Oh, how Mother loved her baby.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I'll name you Stellaluna.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Each night, Mother would carry Stellaluna as she went out to look for food.<br>
 <br>
Once, as Mother followed the smell of fruit, an owl saw her. The bird flew down upon the bats. Mother tried to leave, but the owl came back again, causing Stellaluna to go into the air. Her wings were useless. Down she went.<br>
 <br>
The branches caught Stellaluna as she went. One branch was small enough. Putting her wings around her, she held the branch.<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna said, &quot;Mother, where are you?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Eventually, the bat could hold on no longer. She dropped.<br>
 <br>
Flump! Stellaluna ended up in a nest, scaring the birds there. Stellaluna went from the nest and hung below it. She listened to the three birds.<br>
 <br>
Flap: &quot;What was that?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Flitter: &quot;I don't know, but it's hanging by its feet.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Pip: &quot;Shhh! Here comes Mama.&quot;<br>
 <br>
That day Mama Bird went away, coming back with food for her babies. Stellaluna was hungry - but not for the things Mama Bird had. Finally, the bat could not bear it. She went into the nest, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth. Plop! In went a grasshopper!<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna started to become like the birds. She was awake all day and asleep at night. She ate bugs even though she didn&rsquo;t like them. Her bat ways were going away. Except for one thing: Stellaluna still hung by her feet.</p>
