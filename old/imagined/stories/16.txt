<p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In a sun-warmed</span><span class="c0">68F</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and sultry evergreen forest away</span><span class="c0">30 miles</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from Hapstown, Pennsylvania, there once lived a protective mother pygmy fruit-eating bat named Solarem, and her newborn baby. Solarem loved her soft small</span><span class="c0">4 inches</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;baby like a moth loves a light.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Staring into her baby&rsquo;s eyes, Solarem whispered, &quot;I&#39;ll name you Stellaluna.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Each night</span><span class="c0">6pm</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;after the sun set behind the mountain, Solarem would delicately carry Stellaluna clutched to her smooth, warm</span><span class="c0">101F</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;breast as she caught the cool</span><span class="c0">59F</span><span class="c1">, evening breeze on her way to search for a dinner of Stellaluna&rsquo;s favorite fresh fruits.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">One humid</span><span class="c0">80%</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;summer night</span><span class="c0">7 months</span><span class="c1">, as Solarem followed the rich scent of ripe berries wafting by, a sneaky brown barn owl named Stark spied her from her perch, located above</span><span class="c0">2 feet</span><span class="c1">. On wings quiet</span><span class="c0">15dB</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as a mouse the powerful barn owl swooped down upon the unsuspecting mother and daughter fruit bats. Dodging and shrieking hysterically, her wings batting</span><span class="c0">3Hz</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;fiercely, Solarem tried desperately to escape Stark&rsquo;s menacing sharp talons, but the owl struck</span><span class="c0">6 times</span><span class="c1">, and on the strike</span><span class="c0">7th time</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;sent Stellaluna flying up</span><span class="c0">2 feet</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;into the crisp, night air. Her fragile, baby wings were as limp and useless as soggy paper, crumbling under their own weight</span><span class="c0">10 grams</span><span class="c1">. She fell, accelerating because of gravity at rate</span><span class="c0">9.8 m/s/s</span><span class="c1">, into the unforgiving gathering of evergreen trees far below</span><span class="c0">20 feet</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A particularly thick leafy tangle of intertwined branches captured Stellaluna in its wooden arms with a gentle &ldquo;thump&rdquo; as she fell uncontrollably through the trees. &nbsp;One particularly prominent twig was just the right diameter</span><span class="c0">5mm</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for Stellaluna&#39;s tiny webbed feet</span><span class="c0">8mm</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to clutch. Wrapping her delicate brown wings tightly about her, she clutched the crooked branch, which was about as thin in diameter</span><span class="c0">7mm</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and wrinkled as a worm, and trembled uncontrollably with cold</span><span class="c0">55F</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;chills and paralyzing terror. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Stellaluna squealed as loud</span><span class="c0">103 dB</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as she could into the empty night, &quot;Mother Bat, Where are you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Later</span><span class="c0">3 hours</span><span class="c1">, as the sky was starting to brighten</span><span class="c0">40,000 lux</span><span class="c1">, the baby bat&#39;s body was tired and could hold on no longer. She was forced to let go of the branch. Down far</span><span class="c0">30 feet</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;through the branches, she dropped.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A noise</span><span class="c0">60 dB</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that sounded like a tree falling onto the ground echoed out as Stellaluna landed</span><span class="c0">10 m/s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;headfirst in the heart of a cushioned downy nest, startling the baby Eastern bluebirds</span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;who lived there. In time</span><span class="c0">4 seconds</span><span class="c1">, Stellaluna clambered</span><span class="c0">0.2 m/s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;out of the nest onto the branches below and hung below</span><span class="c0">2 inches</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;it where she could not be seen by them. She listened attentively to the conversation that the bluebirds</span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;were having with each other.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Hearing the commotion, the bluebird</span><span class="c0">1</span><span class="c1">, named Flap, asked the others curiously, &quot;What was that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The bluebird</span><span class="c0">2</span><span class="c1">, named Flitter, responded amusedly, &quot;I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s hanging by its little feet.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The bluebird</span><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c1">, named Pip, warned urgently, &quot;Shhh! Here comes Mama.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The mother bird, named Glide, came to the nest, and then left soon after</span><span class="c0">2 minutes</span><span class="c1">. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That day Glide flew</span><span class="c0">4 times</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to go get food, returning with a beakful of insects</span><span class="c0">2-4 insects</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for her babies to consume for nutrition</span><span class="c0">450 calories</span><span class="c1">. Stellaluna&rsquo;s empty stomach grumbled with hunger- but not for the bugs that Glide gathered that were still crawling when she brought them. Finally</span><span class="c0">4 hours</span><span class="c1">, though, the scrawny bat could bear her hunger any longer. Deciding to eat, Stellaluna climbed into the downy nest next to the bluebirds, closed her frightened eyes, and opened her beak as wide</span><span class="c0">12mm</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as she could. Plop! In dropped an crunchy green grasshopper, named Flick, the size of her head</span><span class="c0">5cm^2</span><span class="c1">! Stellaluna swallowed Flick with a grimace.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That was the first time Stellaluna acted like an Eastern bluebird. Within time</span><span class="c0">2 weeks</span><span class="c1">, Stellaluna learned to act more and more like Flap, Flitter, and Pip. She stayed awake</span><span class="c0">8-18 hours</span><span class="c1">, and slept</span><span class="c0">18-8hrs</span><span class="c1">. She ate the squirmy worms</span><span class="c0">2 per day</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and grasshoppers</span><span class="c0">1 per day</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;even though they tasted like rotten</span><span class="c0">2 weeks old</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;blueberries. Her fruit bat mannerisms were quickly being replaced by bluebird mannerisms. Except for one thing: Stellaluna still preferred to sleep hanging upside-down by the curled toes of her feet.</span></p>
