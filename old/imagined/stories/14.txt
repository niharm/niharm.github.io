 <br>
<p>In a sun-warmed and sultry evergreen forest away from Hapstown, Pennsylvania, there once lived a protective mother pygmy fruit-eating bat named Solerem and her newborn baby. Solarem loved her soft tiny baby like a moth loves a light.<br>
 <br>
Staring into her baby&rsquo;s eyes, Solarem whispered, &quot;I'll name you Stellaluna.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Each night after the sun set behind the mountain, Solarem would delicately carry Stellaluna clutched to her smooth, warm breast as she caught the cool, evening breeze on her way to search for a dinner of Stellaluna&rsquo;s favorite fresh fruits.<br>
 <br>
One humid summer night, as Solarem followed the rich scent of ripe berries wafting by, a sneaky brown barn owl named Stark spied her from her perch, located above. On wings quiet as a mouse the powerful barn owl swooped down upon the unsuspecting mother and daughter fruit bats. Dodging and shrieking hysterically, her wings batting fiercely, Solarem tried desperately to escape Stark&rsquo;s menacing sharp talons, but the owl struck more times, and on the last sent Stellaluna flying many feet into the crisp, night air. Her fragile, baby wings were as limp and useless as soggy paper, crumbling under their own weight. She fell, accelerating because of gravity at rate, into the unforgiving gathering of evergreen trees far below.<br>
 <br>
A particularly thick leafy tangle of intertwined branches captured Stellaluna in its wooden arms with a gentle &ldquo;thump&rdquo; as she fell uncontrollably through the trees. One particularly prominent twig was just the right diameter for Stellaluna's tiny webbed feet to clutch. Wrapping her delicate brown wings tightly about her, she clutched the crooked branch, which was about as thin and wrinkled as a worm, and trembled uncontrollably with cold chills and paralyzing terror. <br>
 <br>
Stellaluna squealed as loud as she could into the empty night, &quot;Mother Bat, Where are you?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Later, as the sky was starting to brighten, the baby bat's body was tired and could hold on no longer. She was forced to let go of the branch. Down many feet through the branches, she dropped.<br>
 <br>
A noise that sounded like a tree falling onto the ground echoed out as Stellaluna landed headfirst in the heart of a cushioned downy nest, startling the baby Eastern bluebirds3 who lived there. In time, Stellaluna clambered out of the nest onto the branches below and hung a few inches below it where she could not be seen by them. She listened attentively to the conversation that the three bluebirds were having with each other.<br>
 <br>
Hearing the commotion, one of the birds, named Flap, asked the others curiously, &quot;What was that?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Another, named Flitter, responded amusedly, &quot;I don't know, but it's hanging by its little feet.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The third, named Pip, warned urgently, &quot;Shhh! Here comes Mama.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The mother bird, named Glide, came to the nest, and then left. </p>

<p>Many, many times that day Glide flew to go get food, returning with a beakful of insects for her babies to consume for nutrition. Stellaluna&rsquo;s empty stomach grumbled with hunger- but not for the bugs that Glide gathered that were still crawling when she brought them. Finally, though, the scrawny bat could bear her hunger any longer. Deciding to eat, Stellaluna climbed into the downy nest next to the bluebirds, closed her frightened eyes, and opened her beak as wide as she could. Plop! In dropped an crunchy green grasshopper, named Flick, the size of her head! Stellaluna swallowed Flick with a grimace.</p>

<p>That was the first time Stellaluna acted like an Eastern bluebird. Within a few weeks, Stellaluna learned to act more and more like Flap, Flitter, and Pip. She stayed awake during the hours that the sun was out, and slept when it was not. She ate the squirmy worms and grasshoppers even though they tasted like rotten blueberries. Her fruit bat mannerisms were quickly being replaced by bluebird mannerisms. Except for one thing: Stellaluna still preferred to sleep hanging upside-down by the curled toes of her feet.</p>
