<br>
<p>Somewhere was an animal and her baby. <br>
 <br>
Mother: &quot;You are Stellaluna.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Sometimes Mother took Stellaluna to look for things.<br>
 <br>
Mother went for food, and an animal saw. The animal went. Mother tried to go, but the animal came back, causing Stellaluna to go. Her wings were bad. She went.<br>
 <br>
The branches got her. One branch was a good size. She held the branch.<br>
 <br>
She said, &quot;Mother, where are you?&quot;<br>
 <br>
The animal could not hold on. She dropped.<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna went in a nest, scaring the animals. Stellaluna left. She heard them.<br>
 <br>
One: &quot;What was that?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Another: &quot;I don't know, but it's there.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Another: &quot;Here&rsquo;s Mama.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Sometimes Mama went and came back with things. Stellaluna was hungry - but not for that. The animal could not wait. She went to the nest and ate a bug!<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna started to change. But she hung the same way.</p>
