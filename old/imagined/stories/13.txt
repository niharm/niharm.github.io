<p>In a sun-warmed and sultry evergreen forest miles away from the nearest town, there once lived a protective mother fruit bat and her newborn baby. Mother Bat loved her soft tiny baby like a moth loves a light.<br>
 <br>
Staring into her baby&rsquo;s eyes, Mother whispered, &quot;I'll name you Stellaluna.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Each night after the sun set behind the mountain, Mother Bat would delicately carry Stellaluna clutched to her smooth, warm breast as she caught the cool, evening breeze on her way to search for a dinner of Stellaluna&rsquo;s favorite fresh fruits.<br>
 <br>
One humid summer night, as Mother Bat followed the rich scent of ripe berries wafting by, a sneaky brown owl spied her from her perch. On wings quiet as a mouse the powerful bird swooped down upon the unsuspecting mother and daughter bats. Dodging and shrieking with fear, her wings batting fiercely, Mother Bat tried desperately to escape the owl&rsquo;s menacing talons, but the owl struck again and again, and sent Stellaluna flying into the crisp, night air. Her fragile, baby wings were as limp and useless as soggy paper, crumbling under their own weight. Down, down she went, faster and faster, into the unforgiving sea of evergreens below.<br>
 <br>
A particularly thick leafy tangle of branches caught Stellaluna in its arms with a gentle &ldquo;thump&rdquo; as she tumbled down. One particularly prominent twig was just the right diameter for Stellaluna's tiny webbed feet. Wrapping her delicate wings tightly about her, she clutched the crooked branch, which was about as thin as a worm, and trembled uncontrollably with cold chills and paralyzing terror. <br>
 <br>
Stellaluna squealed as loud as she could into the empty night, &quot;Mother Bat Where are you?&quot;<br>
 <br>
A few hours later, as the sky was starting to brighten, the baby bat could hold on no longer. Down many feet through the branches, she dropped.<br>
 <br>
Flump! A noise echoed out as Stellaluna landed headfirst in the heart of a cushioned downy nest, startling the three baby bluebirds who lived there. In seconds, Stellaluna clambered from the nest and hung a few inches below it where she could not be seen by them. She listened attentively to the constant babble of the three baby bluebirds.<br>
 <br>
One, named Flap asked the others, &quot;What was that?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Another, named Flitter, responded, &quot;I don't know, but it's hanging by its little feet.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The third, named Pip, warned, &quot;Shhh! Here comes Mama.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Several times that day Mama Bird flew away, returning with a beakful of bugs for her babies to gorge on. Stellaluna&rsquo;s empty stomach grumbled with hunger- but not for the bugs that Mama Bird gathered that were still crawling when she brought them. Finally, though, the scrawny bat could bear her hunger any longer. She climbed into the downy nest, closed her frightened eyes, and opened her beak as wide as she could. Plop! In dropped an crunchy green grasshopper the size of her head!<br>
 <br>
Within a few weeks, Stellaluna learned to act like the other bluebirds. She stayed awake while the sun was out and slept when it was not. She ate the squirmy bugs even though they tasted like rotten berries. Her bat mannerisms were quickly disappearing. Except for one thing: Stellaluna still preferred to sleep hanging upside-down by her feet.</p>
