<br>
<p>In a forest far away, there lived a mother bat and her baby. Oh, how Mother Bat loved her baby.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I'll name you Stellaluna.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Each night, Mother Bat would carry Stellaluna clutched to her as she flew out to search for food.<br />
 <br />
One night, as Mother Bat followed the scent of fruit, an owl spied her. On silent wings the bird swooped down upon the bats. Screaming, Mother Bat tried to escape, but the owl struck again, knocking Stellaluna into the air. Her small wings were useless. Down she went, faster, into the forest below.<br />
 <br />
The branches caught Stellaluna as she fell. One twig was small enough for Stellaluna's feet. Wrapping her wings about her, she clutched the branch, trembling with fear.<br />
 <br />
Stellaluna squealed, &quot;Mother Bat, where are you?&quot;<br />
 <br />
By daybreak, the baby bat could hold on no longer. Down she dropped.<br />
 <br />
Flump! Stellaluna landed in a nest, startling the three birds who lived there. Stellaluna clambered from the nest and hung out of sight below it. She listened to the babble of the three birds.<br />
 <br />
Flap: &quot;What was that?&quot;<br />
 <br />
Flitter: &quot;I don't know, but it's hanging by its feet.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Pip: &quot;Shhh! Here comes Mama.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Many times that day Mama Bird flew away, always returning with food for her babies. Stellaluna was hungry - but not for the things Mama Bird brought. Finally, though, the bat could bear it no longer. She climbed into the nest, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth. Plop! In dropped a grasshopper!<br />
 <br />
Stellaluna learned to be like the birds. She stayed awake all day and slept at night. She ate bugs even though they tasted bad. Her bat ways were disappearing. Except for one thing: Stellaluna still liked to sleep hanging by her feet.</p>
