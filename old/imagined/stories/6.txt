<br>
<p>In a far forest, there lived a bat and her baby. Oh, how Mother Bat loved her baby.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I'll name you Stellaluna.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Each night, Mother Bat would carry Stellaluna as she flew out to search for food.<br>
 <br>
Once, as Mother Bat followed the scent of fruit, an owl spied her. The bird swooped down upon the bats. Mother Bat tried to escape, but the owl struck again, knocking Stellaluna into the air. Her small wings were useless. Down she went into the forest.<br>
 <br>
The branches caught Stellaluna as she fell. One twig was small enough. Wrapping her wings about her, she clutched the branch, trembling.<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna called, &quot;Mother Bat, where are you?&quot;<br>
 <br>
By day, the bat could hold on no longer. Down she dropped.<br>
 <br>
Flump! Stellaluna landed in a nest, scaring the birds who lived there. Stellaluna climbed from the nest and hung out below it. She listened to the talking of the three birds.<br>
 <br>
Flap: &quot;What was that?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Flitter: &quot;I don't know, but it's hanging by its feet.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Pip: &quot;Shhh! Here comes Mama.&quot;<br>
 <br>
That day Mama Bird flew away, always returning with food for her babies. Stellaluna was hungry - but not for the things Mama Bird brought. Finally, the bat could bear it no longer. She climbed into the nest, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth. Plop! In dropped a grasshopper!<br>
 <br>
Stellaluna learned to be like the birds. She stayed awake all day and slept at night. She ate bugs even though they tasted bad. Her bat ways were disappearing. Except for one thing: Stellaluna still liked to sleep hanging by her feet.</p>
