In a warm forest far away, there lived a mother bat and her baby. Oh, how Mother Bat loved her tiny baby.
 
"I'll name you Stellaluna."
 
Each night, Mother Bat would carry Stellaluna clutched to her breast as she flew out to search for food.
 
One night, as Mother Bat followed the scent of ripe fruit, an owl spied her. On silent wings the bird swooped down upon the bats. Dodging and shrieking, Mother Bat tried to escape, but the owl struck again and again, knocking Stellaluna into the air. Her baby wings were limp and useless. Down, down she went, faster and faster, into the forest below.
 
The leafy tangle of branches caught Stellaluna as she fell. One twig was small enough for Stellaluna's tiny feet. Wrapping her wings about her, she clutched the thin branch, trembling with cold and fear.
 
Stellaluna squealed, "Mother Bat, where are you?"
 
By daybreak, the baby bat could hold on no longer. Down, down again she dropped.
 
Flump! Stellaluna landed in a soft nest, startling the three baby birds who lived there. Stellaluna quickly clambered from the nest and hung out of sight below it. She listened to the babble of the three birds.
 
Flap: "What was that?"
 
Flitter: "I don't know, but it's hanging by its feet."
 
Pip: "Shhh! Here comes Mama."
 
Many, many times that day Mama Bird flew away, always returning with food for her babies. Stellaluna was terribly hungry - but not for the crawly things Mama Bird brought. Finally, though, the little bat could bear it no longer. She climbed into the nest, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth. Plop! In dropped a big grasshopper!
 
Stellaluna learned to be like the birds. She stayed awake all day and slept at night. She ate bugs even though they tasted awful. Her bat ways were quickly disappearing. Except for one thing: Stellaluna still liked to sleep hanging by her feet.
